# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the most recent release. Please upgrade to the
latest version for ongoing support.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Please do **not** create public GitHub issues for security reports.
- Use the "Report a vulnerability" link in the repository Security tab to open
  a private advisory with the maintainers.
- If GitHub Security Advisories are unavailable in your region, contact the
  maintainers privately and provide reproduction details so we can investigate.

We will acknowledge receipt as quickly as possible and work with you on a fix
and coordinated disclosure.
